**Ingredients:**

 * Chicken carcass cut into pieces
 * Celery
 * Onion
 * Carrot
 * Water
 * Pepper corns
 * Bay leaf

It is very important to NOT add salt to the stock, since the stock will be used in another recipe.

**Steps:**

1. Cut celery, onions, and carrots, and toast them in the oven with the chicken carcass that is left over from a whole chicken.
2. Remove it from the oven once it has a good browning, and add all of it to a big pot.
3. Cover everything in the pot with water, and then add another cup.
4. Add the pepper corns and bay leaf.
5. Have the stock on the stove cooking on low for about 4-6 hours. Alternatively, add all of it to an instant pot and cook it under high pressure for an hour.
