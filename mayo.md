# Mayonaise

A fresh mayo with a slight touch of garlic and lemon. Very easy to make with a food processor.

## Ingredients

 * Egg yolks (3)
 * Vinegar
 * Avocado oil
 * Olive oil
 * Salt
 * Lemon juice
 * Garlic clove (1)

## Steps

 1. Break the eggs and get rid of the egg white, and put the egg yolks in a food processor.
 2. Add a tbsp of white vinegar, lemon juice, and the garlic clove. Be careful with the amount of garlic because we only want to taste a slight hint of it. 
 3. Blend for 30 seconds.
 4. Add salt.
 5. At this point slowly add avocado oil and blend for 30 seconds repeatedly. Note that only a little bit of oil should be used in the beginning to get the emulsion going. Once the emulsion is going it is fine to add more and more oil between blending.
 6. Once it reaches the desired consistency, blend it one more time but this time with olive oil.
